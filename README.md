# California H-2A visas analysis

By [Ben Welsh](mailto:ben.welsh@latimes.com)

The Los Angeles Times conducted an analysis of temporary visas granted to foreign agricultural workers by the United States Department of Labor via its H-2A program.

The results were reported in a May 25, 2017, Los Angeles Times story titled ["Trump promised a ‘big beautiful door’ in his border wall. California farmers are ready and waiting"](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-farm-labor-guestworkers/).

The Times' findings and analysis are available in the ["analysis" notebook](https://github.com/datadesk/california-h2a-visas-analysis/blob/master/04_analysis.ipynb) in this repository.
